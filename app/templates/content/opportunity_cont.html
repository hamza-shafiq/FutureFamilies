            <p>Teaching parenting and child development in high schools allows reaching virtually all Americans and thereby takes a proactive approach of success from early childhood and beyond.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">High school is our last chance to reach everyone</h2>
            <p>No civic organizations have the same reach as our public school system, and high school is often the last site where virtually all citizens participate. Moreover, school is already the main apparatus for preparing students for civic life and is a key site of socialization, including around public health issues like drunk driving and substance abuse.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Early investment produces abundant returns in human capital</h2>
            <p>According to Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman, the earlier the investment, the greater the return: "Invest in prevention, not remediation. Invest in flourishing lives, not in correcting problems after they appear." Comprehensive, early childhood development is key to later success in education and life. Programs that start at birth (or even before!) strengthen families and society.</p>
