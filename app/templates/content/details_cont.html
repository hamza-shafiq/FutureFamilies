              <li class="details-list mt-4"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Type of grants:</span> All grants are project grants with a work plan, a defined start and end date, and anticipated deliverables.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Eligibility:</span> All U.S. tax exempt public charities as defined by the IRS.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Geographical areas:</span> Organizations domiciled in any U.S. state, territory or posession.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Purpose:</span> Grants are made for research on the efficacy of teaching parenting and child development, broadly defined, at the secondary level and for SEL in the early years.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Maximum amount: </span> For these introductory grants the maximum amount is the amount of the submitted budget up to $55,000. Starting in 2022 or 2023 we expect to add investigational grants targeted for but not limited to researchers having successfully completed an introductory grant. We expect the limit for such grants will be significantly higher.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Indirect costs:</span> Indirect costs up to a maximum of 10% of the total project cost are acceptable. Exceptions for higher amounts may be considered where the demonstrated logical cost allocation method results in such higher amount, providing the overall project budget remains cost effective.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Additional consideration:</span> Additional consideration may be accorded proposals with social and emotional learning and those with additional funding from outside Strengthening Future Families.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Number of grants:</span> In 2021 we expect to make 4 introductory grants. A similar number of grants are expected to be made each subsequent year.</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Key dates:</span> Currently no deadlines have been set and we will respond to every Idea as promptly as possible. All responses will be by email. If we anticipate running out of grants in the current year we will post a statement to that effect near the top of this page with as much advance notice as possible. The notice may include an Idea submission deadline and if it does, the deadline will not be less than 30 days from posting the notice. If a submission deadline is set, we will also notify by email anyone having an active submission that is not yet complete. Completed submissions will not be affected by subsequent application deadlines.
</li>
              <li class="details-list mt-3"><span class="mk-bold blank-space">Dissemination plans: </span>  Broad but realistic research dissemination plans are of interest. Such plans may well include but not be limited to publishing the resulting research report.</li>
