            <p>Next is to learn more about the efficacy of teaching parenting and child development in high schools. To do this, each year starting in 2021, we're offering four grants of up to $55,000 each for organizations led by researchers and research teams interested in how we can better prepare the next generation of parents through our public schools. The goal is improving participant's children's kindergarten readiness and success in school and life.</p>

            <p>We welcome partnerships with schools and school districts, research centers, charitable organizations, universities, and others striving to understand the possibilities of teaching parenting at the secondary level and SEL in the early years. If you are associated with a U.S. high school and would like to learn about our pilot test program, we're especially interested in talking with you.</p>

            <p>Together we look forward to a coalition of dedicated champions actively learning and sharing ideas on how schools may help prepare folks for their critically important future roles as parents and other key people in the lives of young children. As we consider curricula for these folks weâ€™re also interested in how including SEL may provide benefits for their children. By gathering and disseminating research, exchanging ideas, and building our knowledge, we look forward to joining together with others interested in improving our families, our friendships, our working relationships, our communities our country and our world.</p>
